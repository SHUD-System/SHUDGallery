The Simulator for Hydrologic Unstructured Domains (SHUD - pronounced “SHOULD”) is a multi-process, multi-scale integrated hydrological model using the semi-discrete Finite Volume Method.

**Spatial strucutre**: Unstructed mesh domain — irregulated triangular network. Three vertical layers: land surface, unstructured and saturated layers.

**Time-step**: Adaptive time-step based on the spatial resolution and slow-fast hydrological processes. The normal time-step ranges from 1 ~ 60 seconds.

The SHUD modeling system is of quick, reproducible and automatic hydrological modeling.
